# ‚ú® Improved Tracking Controls

This repository contains code for the improved tracking controls that
[Rick Bauer][1] and I demonstrated in our _Crank Up Your Sitecore Authoring
and Marketing Experience_ presentation.

These improved controls make it easier for marketers to manage large sets of
goals, campaigns, page events, and failures.

The improved goal selector is pictured on the right, stock selector on the left:

And the improved attributes selector is on the right, with stock on the left:
